#Intro
OpenLLX is designed for AI App developers looking to research, develop and deploy prod-ready applications based on Open Source LLMs(Large Language Models) by leveraging Cloud-Native Technology.

#Goal
The main goal is to deliver a robust suite of tools and features for fine-tuning, serving, deploying, and monitoring these models, simplifying the end-to-end deployment workflow for LLMs. Based on a DevOps/MLOps/AiOps approach. Everything built must be completely cloud-native at it's core.
